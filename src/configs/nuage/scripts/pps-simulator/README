simulate_pps_stats.py is a simple python program that generates simulated PPS flow logs, probe logs and sla logs in json format and writes in to elasticsearch server

Requirements to run the program: Need to install elasticsearch client package ( pip install elasticsearch )
Elastic search server ip to be configured in the config.ini

Current limitations:
Single Enterprise. And generates flows only across nsgs in the same domain.

Time increment is 30 seconds

In the config.ini file, user can specify the resource counts and the program will generate that many random resource UUIDS and will be used for generating flows, probes and sla logs.

per timestamp:
number of flow records generated = num_of_domains * nsg_cnt * vport_cnt Combinations 2 * app_cnt
Eg: For def_conf: 1 * 4 * 2C2 * 5 = 20

number of probe records generated = nsg_cnt Combinations 2
Eg: For def_conf: 4C2 = 6

number of sla records generated = nsg_cnt/2 * appgrp_cnt
Eg: For def_conf: 4/2 * 2 = 4
