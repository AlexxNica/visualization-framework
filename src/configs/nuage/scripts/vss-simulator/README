1. Create a special ES template such that the index and the data is retrievable in a proper manner.
sh init_template.sh

2. insight.yml by defaults create 10 PGs and 2 VPorts each per PGs. Change that value as you like. Than run:
python flowGenerator.py

Expects following kind of output:
Writing flow information between PG6-VPort1 and PG4-VPort1
Writing flow information between PG4-VPort1 and PG7-VPort1
Writing flow information between PG10-VPort2 and PG3-VPort2
Writing flow information between PG6-VPort2 and PG4-VPort2

About the script:

Script basically create a simulation between randomly picked 2 ports and its data and generated flow data for last 24 hours.
It does that for total no of vports to generate randomized data. 

This scheme should suffice for the basic unit testing. For specific cases, we will change the script later on as required.

python flowGenerator.py
python eventGenerator.py
